This book completely changed how I approach my work day. The concept of "deep work" - focused, uninterrupted time on cognitively demanding tasks - is something I now actively schedule into my calendar.

Key takeaways:
- Shallow work is inevitable but should be minimized
- Deep work is a skill that must be trained
- Create rituals around your deep work sessions
